# Credit Card Fraud Detection using ML Algorithms
This is a course project for EE 401 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, done in collaboration with three of my classmates.

  About
</b>
<p> 
Credit card fraud can be defined as, <i> ‘Unauthorized account activity involving a payment card, by a person for which the         account is not intended’</i>. These frauds cost consumers and banks millions of dollars worldwide, as a response to which several modern fraud-detection techniques are in place today.

<b>
Data Resources
</b>
<p> 
We are working on the dataset provided in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud">Kaggle</a>, which is available under Open Database license.
</p>
<b>
  Proposed Algorithm
</b>
<p>
We decompose the proposed algorithm into three parts:<br>
• Bagging of feature vectors
  <br>
• Assigning weights to the classifier associated with every bag
   <br>
• Obtaining the model for classification
   <br>
• Testing the dataset with obtained classifier
